A Line of Credit (LOC) is a flexible borrowing arrangement that allows individuals or businesses to access funds up to a specified limit as needed. Here are the key points about LOCs:
Pre-approved Limit: An LOC provides a predetermined borrowing limit approved by a financial institution, such as a bank or non-banking financial company (NBFC). This limit is based on factors like the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and any collateral provided (if applicable).
Flexibility: The primary advantage of an LOC is its flexibility. Borrowers can withdraw funds as required and repay them at their own pace, subject to minimum payment requirements. This makes LOCs suitable for handling unexpected expenses, managing cash flow gaps, or covering irregular costs.
Secured vs. Unsecured LOCs:
Unsecured LOCs: These do not require collateral. Borrowers can access funds without promising any assets as security. Unsecured LOCs often have higher interest rates and may be harder to obtain.
Secured LOCs: Examples include home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which are secured by the equity in the borrower’s home. Secured LOCs offer higher credit limits and lower interest rates.


Liquidity Access Line (LAL) is a flexible line of credit designed to assist you with various financing needs. Here’s how it works:
Collateral: You can use eligible securities from your investment account(s) as collateral for the line of credit. These securities serve as a guarantee for the loan.
Financing Options: With an LAL, you have the flexibility to finance different needs without having to liquidate your assets. Some common uses include:
Real Estate Purchases: You can use the line of credit to fund real estate transactions.
Tax Obligations: Cover your tax payments using the LAL.
Business Expenses: Fund business-related costs.

Business Expenses: Fund business-related costs.
Other Financing Needs: The LAL can be used for a variety of purposes.
